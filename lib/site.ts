  },
  {
    q: "How does Embedded Signup work?",
    a: "Embedded Signup opens a Meta-hosted Facebook Login for Business flow. The customer chooses the relevant Business Portfolio, WhatsApp Business Account and number, and the platform completes the server-side connection after Meta returns the authorization result.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Embedded Signup guarantee instant API approval?",
    a: "No. The onboarding popup can make account connection much faster, but Meta controls App Review, business verification, number eligibility and any additional approvals required for a specific account.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use an existing WhatsApp number?",
    a: "It depends on the number's current WhatsApp setup and Meta's supported migration or coexistence options at the time you onboard it. Follow the current options Meta shows during Embedded Signup rather than deleting an existing account without confirming the migration path.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I send bulk or marketing messages?",
    a: "Business-initiated messaging must follow Meta's current opt-in, template, category and policy requirements. WhatsApp Connect Pro automatically excludes contacts without recorded marketing opt-in and contacts marked Do Not Message from campaigns.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the chatbot work?",
    a: "You can create keyword or phrase rules, choose contains or exact matching, set rule priority, add a default fallback reply and optionally tag matching contacts. Replies run from authenticated inbound webhook events while the account subscription is active.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are Meta messaging charges included in the platform price?",
    a: "No. The prices shown are for WhatsApp Connect Pro platform access. WhatsApp Business Platform usage charges billed by Meta are separate and depend on the customer's own account activity and Meta's current pricing.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are subscriptions activated?",
    a: "When Razorpay is configured, secure online payments can be verified server-side and activate the plan automatically. Manual UPI with admin verification remains available as a fallback.",
